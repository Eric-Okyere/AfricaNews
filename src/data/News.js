        description:"The National Labour Commission (NLC) says the ongoing industrial action by the Senior Staff Association of Public Universities in Ghana (SSA-UoG) and the Federation of Universities Senior Staff (FUSSAG) is impeding efforts to address their grievances. Speaking to JoyNews, the Executive Secretary of the NLC, Mr. Ofosu Asamoah, said that his attempts to persuade the striking group to abandon the industrial action in favour of negotiations have been unsuccessful. He believes that prolonging the strike will derail efforts to resolve their issues. Mr. Asamoah consequently expressed hope that the Senior Staff would call off their strike immediately to make room for a scheduled meeting next week."

        description:"Who is Rémy, the Swiss genius who invented a box capable of unlocking access to all TV channels? Rémy is the kind of guy like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates or Elon Musk. Graduating as an engineer two years ahead of his classmates, he leaves early in 2020 for Silicon Valley to create the next startup that will revolutionize his industry. Once there, he quickly teamed up with two other talented engineers and set out to invent a modern and conected television for less than $100. But soon enough, the young team realised that the project was doomed to failure: the price of electronic parts making it impossible for the project to be economically viable. After this failure, Rémy went back to the drawing board and came up with an idea that will revolution the entertainment industry - a box that can be plugged into any TV and give users access to all TV channels and video-on-demand platforms. Offering a seamless viewing experience and eliminates the need for multiple subscriptions.",

        description:"Former Real Madrid team-mates Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema were reunited in the tunnel shortly before kick-off at the Prince Abdullah Al Faisal Stadium on December 26. The pair were all smiles as they exchanged pleasantries. Ronaldo was still smiling 90 minutes later after converting two penalties in a 5-2 win for Al-Nassr. Benzema, though, was the picture of frustration as he left the field and, not longer after, deleted his social media accounts. He knew what was coming: another barrage of abuse. Because while Ronaldo has been the best player in the Saudi Pro League this season, Benzema has been its biggest disappointment. Reigning champions Al-Ittihad have somehow managed to get worse with the French forward up front, and speculation over his future has only intensified after he reportedly failed to report back for training after the Saudi Pro League's winter break.",
